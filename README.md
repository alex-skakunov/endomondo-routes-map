Endomondo Workouts Map
===========================

How to use:

# Make sure you have PHP and Composer installed. This script uses PHP7, but if you have PHP5, just replace "[]" with "array()" in the index.php file.
# composer install - this will download all required libraries
# php index.php - this will generate "points.js" file. It took less then 5 minutes for my 1700 workouts list.
# open index.html and paste your Google Maps API key.
# open index.html in the browser directly. The map should show your workouts.
